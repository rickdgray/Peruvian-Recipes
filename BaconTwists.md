## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but chilled
- 12 slices bacon
- 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
- sesame seeds or poppy seeds (optional)

## Directions
#. Preheat the oven to 375\,\textdegree{}F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray lightly with nonstick spray.
#. Whisk together the eggs, mustard and a splash of water until smooth; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.
#. Dust a work surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry to a 10-by-14-inch rectangle with the shorter side facing you. 
#. Spread the cheese over the top half of the dough, then fold the bottom half over the cheese half and roll lightly to seal. 
#. Cut the dough vertically into 12 even strips; each strip will be slightly thinner than 1 inch.
#. Place a bacon strip on each pastry strip and twist the pastry and bacon together. Place the twists on the prepared baking sheet, pressing down the ends. 
#. Brush the tops with some of the egg wash and sprinkle with salt and sesame seeds or poppy seeds (or both).
#. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the bacon is crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes before removing.
